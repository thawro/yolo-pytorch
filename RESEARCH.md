# Object detectors

## Bag of Freebies (BoF) and Bag of Specials (BoS)
Object detectors are constantly upgraded by addressing two main concepts, that is the Bag of Freebies (**BoF**) and Bag of Specials (**BoS**). 

### Bag of Freebies
Methods that only change the training strategy or only increase the training cost. Usually, a conventional object detector is trained offline. Therefore, researchers always like to take this advantage and develop better training methods which can make the object detector receive better accuracy without increasing the inference cost. The possible BoF include:
* **Data augmentation**:
	* photometric distortions - adjust the brightness, contrast, hue, saturation and noise of an image
	* geometric distortions - add random scaling, cropping, flipping and rotating

### Bag of Specials
Those plugin modules and post-processing methods that only increase the inference cost by a small amount but can significantly improve the accuracy of object detection. Generally speaking, these plugin modules are for enhancing certain attributes in a model, such as enlarging receptive field, introducing attention mechanism, or strengthening feature integration capability, etc. The post-processing is a method for screening model prediction results. The possible BoS include:
* **Enhance receptive field**:
	* Spatial Pyramid Pooling ([SPP](25)) - originated from Spatial Pyramid Matching ([SPM](39)). SPMs original method was to split feature map into several d × d equal blocks, where d can be {1, 2, 3, ...}, thus forming spatial pyramid, and then extracting bag-of-word features. SPP integrates SPM into CNN and use max-pooling operation instead of bag-of-word operation. Since the SPP module will output one dimensional feature vector, it is infeasible to be applied in Fully Convolutional Network (FCN). Thus in the design of [YOLOv3](63), Redmon and Farhadi improved SPP module to the concatenation of max-pooling outputs with kernel size k × k, where k = {1, 5, 9, 13}, and stride equals to 1. Under this design, a relatively large k × k max-pooling effectively increase the receptive field of backbone feature
	* Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling ([ASPP](5)) - exploits multi-scale features by employing multiple dilated convolutions with kernel size = 3 × 3, dilatet ratio = k, stride = 1
	* Receptive Field Block ([RFB](47)) - use several dilated convolutions of k × k kernel, dilated ratio equals to k, and stride equals to 1 to obtain a more comprehensive spatial coverage than ASPP. RFB makes use of multi-branch pooling with varying kernels corresponding to RFs of different sizes, applies dilated convolution layers to control their eccentricities, and reshapes them to generate final representation
* **Attention Module**
	* Squeeze-and-Excitation ([SE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.01507)) - architectural unit designed to improve the representational power of a network by enabling it to perform dynamic channel-wise feature recalibration. Spatial dimensions of block input feature maps are squeezed into a single numeric value using average pooling, then a dense layer (with ReLU) adds non-linearity and output channel complexity is reduced by a ratio and another dense layer (with sigmoid) gives each channel a smooth gating (weight, attention) function to finally weight each input feature map of the block based on using the attention weights. 
	* Spatial Attention Module ([SAM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.06521v2)) - A Spatial Attention Module (introduced in [CBAM](#cbam)) is a module for spatial attention in convolutional neural networks. It generates a spatial attention map by utilizing the inter-spatial relationship of features. Different from the channel attention, the spatial attention focuses on where is an informative part, which is complementary to the channel attention. To compute the spatial attention, we first apply average-pooling and max-pooling operations along the channel axis and concatenate them to generate an efficient feature descriptor. On the concatenated feature descriptor, we apply a convolution layer to generate a spatial attention map which encodes where to emphasize or suppress.
* **Feature Integration**
	* Feature Pyramid Networks ([FPN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.03144)) -  feature extractor that takes a single-scale image of an arbitrary size as input, and outputs proportionally sized feature maps at multiple levels, in a fully convolutional fashion. This process is independent of the backbone convolutional architectures. It therefore acts as a generic solution for building feature pyramids inside deep convolutional networks to be used in tasks like object detection. The construction of the pyramid involves a bottom-up pathway and a top-down pathway. The **bottom-up** pathway is the feedforward computation of the backbone ConvNet, which computes a feature hierarchy consisting of feature maps at several scales with a scaling step of 2. For the feature pyramid, one pyramid level is defined for each stage. The output of the last layer of each stage is used as a reference set of feature maps. For ResNets we use the feature activations output by each stage’s last residual block. The **top-down** pathway hallucinates higher resolution features by upsampling spatially coarser, but semantically stronger, feature maps from higher pyramid levels. These features are then enhanced with features from the bottom-up pathway via lateral connections. Each lateral connection merges feature maps of the same spatial size from the bottom-up pathway and the top-down pathway. The bottom-up feature map is of lower-level semantics, but its activations are more accurately localized as it was subsampled fewer times.
	* Path Aggregation Networks ([PAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01534v4)) - aims to boost information flow in a proposal-based instance segmentation framework. Specifically, the feature hierarchy is enhanced with accurate localization signals in lower layers by bottom-up path augmentation, which shortens the information path between lower layers and topmost feature. Additionally, adaptive feature pooling is employed, which links feature grid and all feature levels to make useful information in each feature level propagate directly to following proposal subnetworks. A complementary branch capturing different views for each proposal is created to further improve mask prediction.
	* Scale-wise Feature Aggregation Module ([SFAM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.04533v3)) - use SE module to execute channel wise level re-weighting on multi-scale concatenated feature maps
	* Adaptively Spatial Feature Fusion ([ASFF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.09516v2)) - learns the way to spatially filter conflictive information to suppress inconsistency across different feature scales, thus improving the scale-invariance of features. ASFF enables the network to directly learn how to spatially filter features at other levels so that only useful information is kept for combination. For the features at a certain level, features of other levels are first integrated and resized into the same resolution and then trained to find the optimal fusion. At each spatial location, features at different levels are fused adaptively, i.e., some features may be filter out as they carry contradictory information at this location and some may dominate with more discriminative clues. ASFF offers several advantages: (1) as the operation of searching the optimal fusion is differential, it can be conveniently learned in back-propagation; (2) it is agnostic to the backbone model and it is applied to single-shot detectors that have a feature pyramid structure; and (3) its implementation is simple and the increased computational cost is marginal.
	* Weighted Bi-directional Feature Pyramid Networks ([BiFPN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.09070v7)) - type of feature pyramid network which allows easy and fast multi-scale feature fusion. It incorporates the multi-level feature fusion idea from FPN, PANet and NAS-FPN that enables information to flow in both the top-down and bottom-up directions, while using regular and efficient connections. It also utilizes a fast normalized fusion technique. Traditional approaches usually treat all features input to the FPN equally, even those with different resolutions. However, input features at different resolutions often have unequal contributions to the output features. Thus, the BiFPN adds an additional weight for each input feature allowing the network to learn the importance of each. All regular convolutions are also replaced with less expensive depthwise separable convolutions. Comparing with PANet, PANet added an extra bottom-up path for information flow at the expense of more computational cost. Whereas BiFPN optimizes these cross-scale connections by removing nodes with a single input edge, adding an extra edge from the original input to output node if they are on the same level, and treating each bidirectional path as one feature network layer (repeating it several times for more high-level future fusion).
* **Activation function**
	* Rectified Linear Unit ([ReLU](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/reluICML.pdf)) - solve the gradient vanish problem which is frequently encountered in traditional tanh and sigmoid activation function
	* Leaky ReLU ([LReLU](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/papers/relu_hybrid_icml2013_final.pdf)) and Parametric ReLU ([PReLU](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.01852)) - solve the problem that the gradient of ReLU is zero when the output is less than zero
	* [ReLU6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04861) and [hard-Swish](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.02244) - specially designed for quantization networks
	* Scaled Exponential Linear Unit ([SELU](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02515v5)) - for self-normalizing a neural network
	* [Swish](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05941v2) and [Mish](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08681) - continuously differentiable activation functions
* **Post-Processing**
	* Non Maximum Supression (NMS / [Greedy NMS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.2524)) - Non-maximum suppression is an integral part of the object detection pipeline. First, it sorts all detection boxes on the basis of their scores (Greedy NMS). The detection box **M** with the maximum score is selected and all other detection boxes with a significant overlap (using a pre-defined threshold) with **M** are suppressed. This process is recursively applied on the remaining boxes. As per the design of the algorithm, if an object lies within the predefined overlap threshold, it leads to a miss. 
	* [soft NMS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04503v2) - it considers the problem that the occlusion of an object may cause the degradation of confidence score in greedy NMS with IoU score. Soft-NMS solves classic NMS problem by decaying the detection scores of all other objects as a continuous function of their overlap with M. Hence, no object is eliminated in this process.
	* [DIoU NMS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.08287v1) - added the information of the center point distance to the bbox screening process on the basis of soft NMS. In original NMS, the IoU metric is used to suppress the redundant detection boxes, where the overlap area is the unique factor, often yielding false suppression for the cases with occlusion. With DIoU-NMS, we not only consider the overlap area but also central point distance between two boxes.

# YOLO

## **YOLO v1**
2016 | [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640.pdf) | _You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection_

YOLOv1 is a **single-stage** object detection model. Object detection is framed as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance.

</p>

### How it works:
* YOLO divides the input image into an S × S grid. If the center of an object falls into a grid cell, that grid cell is responsible for detecting that object.
* Each grid cell predicts B bounding boxes and confidence scores for those boxes. These confidence scores reflect how
confident the model is that the box contains an object and also how accurate it thinks the box is that it predicts. The confidence score is defined as _Pr(Object) ∗ IoU(pred, gt)_. If no object exists in that cell, the confidence scores should be zero. Otherwise we want the confidence score to equal the intersection over union (IOU) between the predicted box and the ground truth.
* Each bounding box consists of 5 predictions: _x_, _y_, _w_, _h_, and confidence. The _(x, y)_ coordinates represent the center of the box relative to the bounds of the grid cell. The width and height are predicted relative to the whole image. Finally the confidence prediction represents the IoU between the predicted box and any ground truth box.
* Each grid cell also predicts _C_ conditional class probabilities, _Pr(Class_i|Object)_. These probabilities are conditioned on the grid cell containing an object. We only predict one set of class probabilities per grid cell, regardless of the number of boxes _B_.
* predictions are encoded as an _S × S × (B ∗ 5 + C)_ tensor (_S_ - grid size, _B_ - number of bboxes, _C_ - number of classes). In paper: 7 × 7 × 30, that is _S = 7_, _B = 2_, _C = 20_ (PASCAL VOC has 20 labels)

</p>

### Model architecture:
* The initial convolutional layers of the network extract features from the image while the fully connected layers predict the output probabilities and coordinates.
* The network architecture is inspired by the GoogLeNet. It has 24 convolutional layers followed by 2 fully connected layers
* Instead of the inception modules used by GoogLeNet, the _1 × 1_ conv reduction layers followed by _3 × 3_ convolutional layers are used
* To avoid overfitting use dropout and extensive data augmentation. A dropout layer with _rate = 0.5_ after the first connected layer prevents co-adaptation between layers

### Loss function
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/thawro/yolo-pytorch/assets/50373360/a29f820b-b37f-472e-b5ea-52456b4383eb" alt="yolo_loss" width="500"/>
</p>

### Training details:
* pretrain first 20 conv layers (+ global pool and fc) as classifier on the ImageNet -> val top-5 88% accuracy
* add 4 conv layers and 2 fc layers on top of the pretrained backbone and increase input size from 224 to 448 to train the detector
* normalize bbox width and height to _[0, 1]_ and parametrize bbox x and y to be offsets of a particular grid cell location so they are also bounded in _[0, 1]_
* LeakyReLU(0.1)
* use different loss weights for case of no object cell and for coordinate losses
* use squared root of width and height in loss (to reflect that small deviations in large boxes matter less than in small boxes)
* YOLO predicts multiple bounding boxes per grid cell. At training time only one bbox predictor
is responsible for each object. One predictor is assigned to be “responsible” for predicting an object based on which prediction has the highest current IoU with the ground truth. This leads to specialization between the bounding box predictors. Each predictor gets better at predicting certain sizes, aspect ratios, or classes of object, improving overall recall
* The loss function only penalizes classification error if an object is present in that grid cell. It also only penalizes bbox coordinate error if that predictor is “responsible” for the ground truth box (i.e. has the highest IoU of any predictor in that grid cell)
* Training scheme:
	* 135 epochs on the training and validation data sets from PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 (when testing on 2012 we also include the VOC 2007 test data for training)
	* batch size = 64
	* momentum = 0.9 
	* weight decay = 0.0005
	* Learning rate schedule:
		* For the first epochs slowly raise the learning rate from 0.001 to 0.01 (If started at a high learning rate the model often diverges due to unstable gradients)
		* Continue training with 0.01 for 75 epochs
		* Then 0.001 for 30 epochs
		* Finally 0.0001 for 30 epochs
	* data augmentation:
		* random scaling,
		* translations of up to 20% of the original image size
		* randomly adjust the exposure and saturation of the image by up to a factor of 1.5 in the HSV color space

## **YOLO v2**
2016 | [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.08242.pdf) | _YOLO9000: Better, Faster, Stronger_

YOLOv2 (or YOLO9000) is a single-stage real-time object detection model. It improves upon [_YOLOv1_](#yolo-v1) in several ways, including the use of Darknet-19 as a backbone, batch normalization, use of a high-resolution classifier, multi-scale training, the use of dimension clusters, fine-grained features and direct location prediction to predict bounding boxes, and more

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/thawro/yolo-pytorch/assets/50373360/3956c34f-f205-4366-9cbb-83f2308689d6" alt="yolo_v2" height="250"/>
</p>

### How it works:
It works similar to the YOLOv1, the main differences include each predicted bbox has its own C class probabilities, so the predictions are encoded as an _S × S × (B ∗ (5 + C))_ tensor and added passtrough layer, dimension clusters prior and direct location prediction for easier training.
Main improvements:
* **Batch Normalization** - leads to significant improvements in convergence while eliminating the need for other forms of regularization (removed dropout from fc). By adding batch normalization on all of the convolutional layers in YOLO mAP improved by more than 2%
* **High Resolution Classifier** - the original YOLO trains the classifier network at _224 × 224_ and increases the resolution to 448 for detection. This means the network has to simultaneously switch to learning object detection and adjust to the new input resolution. For YOLOv2 we first fine tune the classification network at the full _448 × 448_ resolution for 10 epochs on ImageNet. This gives the network time to adjust its filters to work better
on higher resolution input. Then finetune the resulting network on detection. This high resolution classification network gives an increase of almost 4% mAP
* **Dimension Clusters** - authors encountered two issues with anchor boxes when using them with YOLO. The first is that the box dimensions are hand picked. If better priors for anchor boxes are picked for the network to start with it can make it easier to learn to predict good detections. Instead of choosing priors by hand, _k-means_ clustering is used on the training set bounding boxes to automatically find good priors. Distance metric is based on IoU, that is: _d(box, centroid) = 1 − IoU(box, centroid)_. By analysis, the _k = 5_ value is chosen for the number of priors.
* **Direct location prediction** - Instead of predicting offsets (for anchors) the similar to YOLOv1 approach is used, that is predict location coordinates relative to the location of the grid cell. This bounds the ground truth to fall in _[0, 1]_. The Logistic activation function is used to constrain the network’s predictions to fall in this range. The network predicts 5 bboxes at each cell in the output feature map. The network predicts 5 coordinates for each bbox, _tx_, _ty_ , _tw_, _th_, and to. If the cell is offset from the top left corner of the image by _(cx, cy )_ and the bbox prior has width and height _pw_, _ph_, then the predictions correspond to:

</p>

* **Fine-Grained Features** - YOLOv2 predicts detections on a _13 × 13_ feature map. While this is sufficient for large objects, it may benefit from finer grained features for localizing smaller objects. The passthrough layer is added that brings features from an earlier layer at _26 × 26_ resolution. The passthrough layer concatenates the higher resolution features with the low resolution features by stacking adjacent features into different channels instead of spatial locations, similar to the identity mappings in ResNet. This turns the _26 × 26 × 512_ feature map into a _13 × 13 × 2048_ feature map, which can be concatenated with the original features
* **Multi-Scale Training**. The original YOLO uses an input resolution of _448 × 448_. With the addition of anchor boxes the resolution is changed to _416 × 416_. However, since the model only uses convolutional and pooling layers it can be resized on the fly. The YOLOv2 is designed to be robust to running on images of different sizes. Instead of fixing the input image size, it is changed every few iterations. Every 10 batches a new image dimension size is chosen from multiples of 32 (model downsamples by a factor of 32): {320, 352, ..., 608}  Thus the smallest option is _320 × 320_ and the largest is _608 × 608_.

### Model architecture:
**Darknet-19** - a new classification model to be used as the backbone of YOLOv2. Similar to the VGG models, Darknet-19 use mostly _3 × 3_ filters and double the number of channels after every pooling step. Following the work on Network in Network (NIN) the global average pooling to is used make predictions as well as _1 × 1_ filters to compress the feature representation between _3 × 3_ convolutions. Batch normalization is used to stabilize training, speed up convergence, and regularize the model. The final model, called Darknet-19, has 19 convolutional layers and 5 maxpooling It achieves 72.9% top-1 accuracy and 91.2% top-5 accuracy on ImageNet.

### Training details:
**Training for classification** - the network is trained on the standard ImageNet 1000 class classification dataset for 160 epochs using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a starting learning rate of 0.1, polynomial rate decay with a power of 4, weight decay of 0.0005 and momentum of 0.9. During training the standard data augmentation tricks are used, including random crops, rotations, and hue, saturation, and exposure shifts. As discussed above, after initial training on images at _224 × 224_ the model is finetuned at a larger size, _448_ for 10 epochs starting at learning rate of 0.001. After finetuning the model achieves a top-1 accuracy of 76.5% and a top-5 accuracy of 93.3%.

**Training for detection** - for detection the last convolutional layer is removed and instead three _3 × 3_ convolutional layers are added (each with 1024 filters) and a final _1 × 1_ convolutional layer with the number of outputs needed for detection (for VOC 5 boxes are predicted, each with 5 coordinated and 20 classes, so 125 filters in total). The passtrough layer is also added from the final _3 × 3 × 512_ layer to the second to last convolutional layer so that the model can use fine grain features. The network is trained for 160 epochs with a starting
learning rate of 0.001, dividing it by 10 at 60 and 90 epochs. The weight decay is 0.0005, momentum is 0.9 and data augmentation includes random crops, color shifting, and other similar to YOLO and SSD

## **YOLO v3**
2018 | [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02767.pdf) | _YOLOv3: An Incremental Improvement_
_YOLOv3_ is a real-time, single-stage object detection model that builds on [_YOLOv2_](#yolo-v2) with several improvements. Improvements include the use of a new backbone network, Darknet-53 that utilises residual connections, as well as some improvements to the bbox prediction step, and use of three different scales from which to extract features. Ultralytics implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3).

### How it works:
* Similar to YOLOv2, the model outputs a tensor of size _S × S × [B ∗ (5 + C)]_, but now the model outputs bboxes at three different scales
* Different to previous versions, YOLOv3 uses multiple independent logistic classifiers rather than one softmax layer for each class. During training, they use binary cross-entropy loss in a one vs all setup (using a softmax imposes the assumption that each box has exactly one class which is often not the case - the multilabel approach better models the data)
* The bigger backbone is used (DarkNet-53) for feature extraction - the architecture has alternative _1 × 1_ and _3 × 3_ convolution layers and skip/residual connections inspired by the ResNet model. Although DarkNet53 is smaller than ResNet101 or RestNet-152, it is faster and has equivalent or better performance
* The idea of FPN (Feature Pyramid Networks) is added to leverage the benefit from all the prior computations and fine-grained features early on in the network
* The bboxes anchors are defined using k-means (same as in YOLOv2), but YOLOv3 uses three prior boxes for different scales

### Model architecture:
* **Darknet-53 classifier** - The network is a hybrid approach between the network used in YOLOv2 (Darknet-19), and the residual networks. It uses successive _3 × 3_ and _1 × 1_ convolutional layers but now has some shortcut connections as well and is significantly larger (53 layers)

</p>

* **Detector** - From the base feature extractor several convolutional layers are added:
	* The last of these predicts a _3-d_ tensor encoding bounding box, objectness, and class predictions. For COCO the predictions include 3 boxes at each scale so the tensor is _S × S × [3 ∗ (4 + 1 + 80)]_ for the 4 bbox offsets, 1 objectness prediction, and 80 class predictions
 	* Next the feature map from 2 layers previous is taken and is upsampled by 2x. The feature map from earlier point in the network is also taken and it is merged with the upsampled features using concatenation. This method allows to get more meaningful semantic information from the upsampled features and finer-grained information from the earlier feature map. On top of that a few more convolutional layers are added to process this combined feature map, and eventually predict a similar tensor (_S × S × [3 ∗ (4 + 1 + 80)]_), although now twice the size.
  	* The same design if performed one more time to predict boxes for the final scale. Thus the predictions for the 3rd scale benefit from all the prior computation as well as fine-grained features from early on in the network.

### Training details:
The network is trained similar to YOLOv2


## **YOLO v4**
2020 | [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10934.pdf) | _YOLOv4: Optimal Speed and Accuracy of Object Detection_

YOLOv4 addresses the need for real-time object detection systems that can achieve high accuracy while maintaining fast inference speeds and possibility to train the object detector on a single customer GPU. Authors of the paper put a great emphasis on analyzing and evaluating the possible training and architectural choices for object detector training and architecture. Two sets of concepts were evaluated separately, that is the Bag of Freebies ([**BoF**](#bag-of-freebies)) and Bag of Specials ([**BoS**](#bag-of-specials)). 

Authors noticed that the reference model which is optimal for classification is not always optimal for a detector. In contrast to the classifier, the detector requires the following:
* Higher input network size (resolution) – for detecting multiple small-sized objects
* More layers – for a higher receptive field to cover the increased size of input network
* More parameters – for greater capacity of a model to detect multiple objects of different sizes in a single image
They also noticed that the influence of the receptive field with different sizes is summarized as follows:
* Up to the object size - allows viewing the entire object
* Up to network size - allows viewing the context around the object
* Exceeding the network size - increases the number of connections between the image point and the final activation


### How it works:

Different settings of BoF and BoS were tested for two backbones, that is CSPResNext50 and CSPDarknet53 (CSP module applied to ResNext50 and Darknet53 architectures). The settings include:
* Activations: ReLU, leaky-ReLU, Swish, or Mish
* bbox regression loss: MSE, IoU, GIoU, CIoU, DIoU
* Data augmentation: CutOut, MixUp, CutMix, Mosaic, Self-Adversarial Training
* Regularization method: DropBlock
* Normalization of the network activations by their mean and variance: Batch Normalization ([BN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03167)), Cross-Iteration Batch Normalization ([CBN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.05712))
* Skip-connections: Residual connections, Weighted residual connections, Multiinput weighted residual connections, or Cross stage partial connections (CSP)
* Eliminate grid sensitivity problem - equation used in YOLOv3 to calculate object coordinates had a flaw related to the need of very high absolute values predictions for points on grid. Authors solved this problem through multiplying the sigmoid by a factor exceeding 1.0, so eliminating the effect of grid on which the object is undetectable
* IoU threshold - using multiple anchors for a single ground truth IoU (truth, anchor) > IoU threshold
* Optimized Anchors - using the optimized anchors for training with the 512x512 network resolution

In order to make the designed detector more suitable for training on single GPU, authors made additional design and improvement as follows:
* Introduced a new method of data augmentation - Mosaic, and Self-Adversarial Training (SAT)
	* Mosaic - represents a new data augmentation method that mixes 4 training images. Thus 4 different contexts are while CutMix mixes only 2 input images. This allows detection of objects outside their normal context. In addition, batch normalization calculates activation statistics from 4 different images on each layer. This significantly reduces the need for a large mini-batch size
	* Self-Adversarial Training (SAT) - new data augmentation technique that operates in 2 forward backward stages. In the 1st stage the neural network alters the original image instead of the network weights. In this way the neural network executes an adversarial attack on itself, altering the original image to create the deception that there is no desired object on the image. In the 2nd stage, the neural network is trained to detect an object on this modified image in the normal way
* Selected optimal hyper-parameters while applying genetic algorithms
* Modified some exsiting methods to make YOLOv4 design suitble for efficient training and detection - modified SAM, modified PAN, and Cross mini-Batch Normalization (CmBN)

### Model architecture:

YOLOv4 consists of:
* Backbone - CSPDarknet53

## **YOLOv5**
2020 | [code](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5), [docs](https://docs.ultralytics.com/yolov5/tutorials/architecture_description/) | _YOLOv5_

YOLOv5 is built on top of the work of [_YOLO v3_](#yolo-v3) and [_YOLO v4_](#yolo-v4). All the YOLOv5 models are composed of the same 3 components: _CSP-Darknet53_ as a backbone, [_SPP_](#SPP) (**S**patial **P**yramid **P**ooling) and [_PANet_](#PAN) (**P**ath **A**ggregation **Net**works) in the model neck and the head used in YOLOv4. Most of the YOLOv5 blocks are improved using the [_CSP_](#CSP) (**C**ross **S**tage **P**artial) module.

The key changes in YOLOv5 that didn't exist in previous version are: applying the CSPNet to the Darknet53 backbone, the integration of the Focus layer (conv 6x6) to the CSP-Darknet53 backbone, replacing the SPP block by the SPPF block in the model neck and applying the CSPNet strategy on the PANet model. YOLOv5 and YOLOv4 tackled the problem of grid sensitivity and can now detect easily bounding boxes having center points in the edges. Finally, YOLOv5 is lighter and faster than previous versions.

</p>

### How it works:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/thawro/yolo-pytorch/assets/50373360/821b0953-8822-4cfe-bde4-fdfcfc6f2fa1" alt="yolo_v5_brief" height="200"/>
</p>

* The image is processed through an input layer (input) and sent to the backbone for feature extraction.
* Backbone - creates feature maps of different sizes
* Neck - fuses these features through the feature fusion network to finally generate three feature maps P3, P4, and P5 (in the YOLOv5, the dimensions are expressed with the size of _80 × 80_, _40 × 40_ and _20 × 20_) to detect small, medium, and large objects in the picture, respectively.
* Head - three feature maps are sent to the prediction head, the confidence calculation and bbox regression are executed for each pixel in the feature map using the prior anchors, so as to obtain a multi-dimensional array (bboxes) including object class, class confidence, box coordinates, width, and height information.
* Postprocessing (NMS) - by setting the corresponding thresholds (confthreshold, objthreshold) to filter the useless information in the array, and performing a non-maximum suppression (NMS) process, the final detection is done

### Model architecture:

An example of yolov5L architecture:

<p align="center">

</p>

* **Bakcbone** - _CSP-Darknet53_ architecture based on Darknet53 from YOLOv3 to which the authors applied the Cross Stage Partial (_CSP_) network strategy.
YOLO is a deep network, it uses residual and dense blocks in order to enable the flow of information to the deepest layers and to overcome the vanishing gradient problem. However one of the perks of using dense and residual blocks is the problem of redundant gradients. _CSPNet_ helps tackling this problem by truncating the gradient flow. According to the authors of CSP:

> _CSP_ network preserves the advantage of _DenseNet's_ feature reuse characteristics and helps reducing the excessive amount of redundant gradient information by truncating the gradient flow.

_YOLOv5_ employs _CSPNet_ strategy to partition the feature map of the base layer into two parts and then merges them through a cross-stage hierarchy as shown in the figure bellow

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/thawro/yolo-pytorch/assets/50373360/e7bf01c8-a015-4f49-a216-e3549a4c3612" alt="yolo_v5_CSP" height="250"/>
</p>

Applying this strategy comes with big advantages to YOLOv5, since it helps reducing the number of parameters and helps reducing an important amount of computation (less FLOPS) which lead to increasing the inference speed that is crucial parameter in real-time object detection models

* **Neck** - YOLOv5 brought two major changes to the model neck. First a variant of Spatial Pyramid Pooling (_SPP_) has been used, and the Path Aggregation Network (_PANet_) has been modified by incorporating the _BottleNeckCSP_ in its architecture

_PANet_ is a feature pyramid network, it has been used in previous version of YOLO (YOLOv4) to improve information flow and to help in the proper localization of pixels in the task of mask prediction. In YOLOv5 this network has been modified by applying the CSPNet strategy to it as shown in the network's architecture figure

_SPP_ block performs an aggregation of the information that receives from the inputs and returns a fixed length output. Thus it has the advantage of significantly increasing the receptive field and segregating the most relevant context features without lowering the speed of the network. This block has been used in previous versions of YOLO (YOLOv3 and YOLOv4) to separate the most important features from the backbone, however in YOLOv5(6.0/6.1) SPPF has been used , which is just another variant of the SPP block, to improve the speed of the network (same outputs, but faster).

<p align="center">

</p>

* **Head** - _YOLOv5_ uses the same head as _YOLOv3_ and _YOLOv4_. It is composed from three convolution layers that predicts the location of the bounding boxes _(x, y, height, width)_, the scores and the objects classes. The equation to compute the target coordinates for the bounding boxes have changed from previous versions, the difference is shown in the figure bellow.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/thawro/yolo-pytorch/assets/50373360/8d62b83e-0916-4a2c-a37f-ae3e731f5301" alt="yolo_v5_head_eq" height="150"/>
</p>

* **Activation** - for YOLOv5 the authors went with _SiLU_ and _Sigmoid_ activation function. _SiLU_ stands for Sigmoid Linear Unit and it is also called the swish activation function. It has been used with the convolution operations in the hidden layers. While the Sigmoid activation function has been used with the convolution operations in the output layer

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/thawro/yolo-pytorch/assets/50373360/3e2142d1-4b9e-4816-b5d5-0aacb69a3bb9" alt="yolo_v5_activation" height="200"/>
</p>

### Loss function
YOLOv5 returns three outputs: the classes of the detected objects, their bounding boxes and the objectness scores. Thus, it uses _BCE_ (Binary Cross Entropy) to compute the classes loss and the objectness loss. While [_CIoU_](#ciou) (Complete Intersection over Union) loss to compute the location loss. The loss in YOLOv5 is computed as a combination of three individual loss components:

* Classes Loss (**BCE Loss**) - Binary Cross-Entropy loss, measures the error for the classification task.
* Objectness Loss (**BCE Loss**) - Another Binary Cross-Entropy loss, calculates the error in detecting whether an object is present in a particular grid cell or not.
* Location Loss (**CIoU Loss**) - Complete IoU loss, measures the error in localizing the object within the grid cell.

The formula for the final loss is given by the following equation

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/thawro/yolo-pytorch/assets/50373360/57d86a5a-2f08-4a34-a7bd-21fd39a9988b" alt="yolo_v5_loss" height="40"/>
</p>

The objectness losses of the three prediction layers (P3, P4, P5) are weighted differently. The balance weights are _[4.0, 1.0, 0.4]_ respectively. This approach ensures that the predictions at different scales contribute appropriately to the total loss.

<p align="center">

</p>

### Other improvements

* **First conv layers** - replaced the three first layers of the network with single 6x6 convolution. It helped reducing the number of parameters, the number of FLOPS and the CUDA memory while improving the speed of the forward and backward passes with minor effects on the mAP.
* **Eliminating grid sensitivity** - It was hard for the previous versions of YOLO to detect bounding boxes on image corners mainly due to the equations used to predict the bounding boxes, but the new equations presented above helped solving this problem by expanding the range of the center point offset from [0, 1] to _[-0.5, 1.5]_ (left) therefore the offset can be easily 1 or 0 (coordinates can be in the image's edge) as shown in the image in the left. Also the height and width scaling ratios (right) were unbounded in the previous equations which may lead to training instabilities but now this problem has been reduced.

</p>

* **Targets building** - the targets building process in YOLOv5 is critical for training efficiency and model accuracy. It involves assigning ground truth boxes to the appropriate grid cells in the output map and matching them with the appropriate anchor boxes. This process follows these steps:
    1. Calculate the ratio of the ground truth box dimensions and the dimensions of each anchor template
    2. If the calculated ratio is within the threshold, match the ground truth box with the corresponding anchor
    3. Assign the matched anchor to the appropriate cells, keeping in mind that due to the revised center point offset, a ground truth box can be assigned to more than one anchor. Because the center point offset range is adjusted from _[0, 1]_ to _[-0.5, 1.5]_. GT Box can be assigned to more anchors.

### Training details:
YOLOv5 applies several sophisticated training strategies to enhance the model's performance. They include
* **Multiscale Training** - the input images are randomly rescaled within a range of 0.5 to 1.5 times their original size during the training process
* **Warmup** and **Cosine LR Scheduler** - a method to adjust the learning rate to enhance model performance
* **AutoAnchor** - this strategy optimizes the prior anchor boxes to match the statistical characteristics of the ground truth boxes for custom data
* **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)** - A strategy that uses the average of parameters over past steps to stabilize the training process and reduce generalization error
* **Mixed Precision Training** - A method to perform operations in half-precision format, reducing memory usage and enhancing computational speed
* **Hyperparameter Evolution** - A strategy to automatically tune hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance.
* **Data augmentation**:
	* _Mosaic Augmentation_ - combines four training images into one in ways that encourage object detection
 	* _Copy-Paste Augmentation_ - copies random patches from an image and pastes them onto another randomly chosen image, effectively generating a new training sample models to better handle various object scales and translations
	* _Random Affine Transformations_ - this includes random rotation, scaling, translation, and shearing of the images
 	* _MixUp Augmentation_ - creates composite images by taking a linear combination of two images and their associated labels
	* _HSV Augmentation_ - random changes to the Hue, Saturation, and Value of the images
	* _Random Horizontal Flip_ - randomly flips images horizontally
